# Analysis of Algorithms

## Exercise I

Give an analysis of the running time of each snippet of
pseudocode with respect to the input size n of each of the following:

```python
a)  a = 0
    while (a < n * n * n):
      a = a + n * n
```


```
b)  sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
      j = 1
      while j < n:
        j *= 2
        sum += 1
```

```
c)  def bunnyEars(bunnies):
      if bunnies == 0:
        return 0

      return 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1)
```

## Exercise II

Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor f or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor f. Devise a strategy to determine the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode AND give the runtime complexity of your solution.

i would use binary search for this problem.
the proposed algorithm runtime would be O(log n)

if there is 100 floors we could start at 50 and drop an egg
if it breaks, we know that 50 is too high and can search between 0-49
if it doesn't break on (49 / 2) we can go halfway up from that
constantly halving until we find the safe floor
