#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  runtime: O(n)
    the amount of iterations is 1:1 with n

b)  runtime: O(nlogn)
    the amount of iterations in the outer loop is a 1:1 scale with n, making it O(n)
    the inner loop is doing j *= 2 which would cut the loop off twice as fast, making it O(log n)

c)  runtime: O(n)
    the amount of iterations is 1:1 with bunnies
